    Click the coloured buttons to change the colour of the cell<br />
    and any adjacent cells of the same colour. Changing it to the<br />
    same colour as any adjacent cells of that colour will add them<br />
    to the group. Try to turn all of the cells to one colour in as<br />
    few moves as possible.
