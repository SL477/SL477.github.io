- NavBar, I finally decided to listen to [why you shouldn't use details as a menu](https://melsumner.github.io/details-as-a-menu). I followed the guide on [CSS only accessible nav menu](https://moderncss.dev/css-only-accessible-dropdown-navigation-menu/) and the [Aria guide on menus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/examples/disclosure-navigation/). And tried to fill in the many gaps in the two.
