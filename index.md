## Developer

My main experience from work is as a developer for [Elite 3E](https://www.elite.com/3e/) (VB.Net & SQL) and [MatterSphere](https://www.elite.com/3e/matter-management/) (C#). This involves creating new screens and workflows and integrating them with various APIs. As well as these I have made an ASP.Net site serving a Vue.JS application, and various other JavaScript applications.

In my spare time I have created various apps in Python, JavaScript, React Native and Android. Plus I have some experience in PHP.
