							My main experience from work is as a developer for <a href="https://www.elite.com/3e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elite 3E</a> (VB.Net &amp; SQL) and <a href="https://www.elite.com/3e/matter-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MatterSphere</a> (C#).
							This involves creating new screens and workflows and integrating them with various APIs.
							As well as these I have made an ASP.Net site serving a Vue.JS application, and various other JavaScript applications.
						</p>
						<p>
							In my spare time I have created various apps in Python, JavaScript, React Native and Android. Plus I have some experience in PHP.

						<h3>SMS Classifier</h3>
						<p>
							This project originally started as my answer to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/neural-network-sms-text-classifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCodeCamp SMS Classifier</a> and my answer is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19jhS_47-0m7Et4vjutHWq9ftKHvPyl62#scrollTo=J9tD9yACG6M9">here</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this project I created my first Flask Web App (not including the tutorial I did). Plus my first Docker Container (outside of a tutorial). Originally this used TensorFlow as the machine learning library, but I have now changed this to SciKit Learn.
						</p>

						</figure>
						<p>
							In the web app you can test the classification of various texts, the client side JavaScript will post a request to the API which in turn will consult the saved SKLearn model. You can then press the "Add to database" button, this will push it into the local database (a SQLite database inside the Docker container). In the data table at the front end you can flip the classification of messages between spam and ham. You can also delete that entry out of the database.
							Pressing the "Retrain Model" button will cause the Flask server to retrain the Machine Learning model on the data in the SQLite database. It will then test the model against the validation data from FreeCodeCamp (the main data is also from FreeCodeCamp). This may take a little while, it will then save the model in the Docker container and then use that. To build the model manually you can run the file modelmaker.py.

						<h3>Predict Health Costs With Regression</h3>
						<p>
							This project started as my answer to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/linear-regression-health-costs-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCodeCamp Predict Health Costs With Regression</a> and my answer is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lmV4xnToA9_rpmDHTrjD99WCdUqFrw11#scrollTo=3G91tB76GpV5">here</a>.

						<p>
							Here I created my first Streamlit App, and then discovered how hard it was to put streamlit into a Docker container.

							Here you can see the difference between the model's predictions and the actual data. You can then use the controls to predict your health costs.

							This started life with the JavaScript being in charge of the visualisations in D3. This used a huge amount of code to draw the graph. 
							I then decided to get Python to parse the data and draw the graph, passing the Base64 string back to JavaScript. 
							Jupyter Labs was useful to design the function and then I copied the code out into a python file.
						</p>
						<p>
							After quite a few attempts I got the app onto Heroku <a href="https://limitless-ridge-52978.herokuapp.com/static/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a>. 
							This was quite a bit more complicated than I thought it would be. I first found out about the existance of Gunicorn and then how to use it. From this I also found out about using .env files in Python (something that I had done in Node.JS and thought would be a good idea in Python).

						<h3>My programming journey</h3>
						<p>
							I first starting programming at school (JavaScript and GameMaker Language), but then took something of a hiatus as first I went through my maths degree (where I learnt a bit of MATLAB) and then I started learning to code again 
							before I got my job at McMillan Williams. As I had got a job in accounting, I then started studying for the ACCA accounting qualification. 
							To make my job easier I had made a couple of Excel Macros. Then I transferred onto the project team for the new finance system of 3E. 
							As this was written in VB.Net this was familiar to me from working on Excel VBA and I switched to being half finance and half software developer. 
							As the project ramped up, and I learnt to program in VB.Net (by learning C#) and SQL in most the 3E training sessions and in my own time, 
							I was transferred full time onto the project team (fortunately a couple of weeks after I had enough accounting experience for the ACCA). 
							(I had also learnt OQL, a bit like entity framework and written like SQL but in Visual Basic; and XSLT which is used in 3E's templating system)
						</p>
						<p>
							After a year or so as a developer, to round out my practical knowledge with some theory, I joined freeCodeCamp.org. 
							There I learnt a lot of the theory behind a lot of what I was doing and was able to use a lot of this in practice.
							I had also joined the 3E-MatterSphere team, which used C# as its main programming language and showed a completely different style of programming and database management.
							3E has a highly normalised database and a very structured way of doing things (and uses ASP.Net to build the front-end). 
							3E-MatterSphere has a much smaller database (100 or so tables rather than 3000+) and its frontend are forms as a Microsoft Office plugin.
							To extend 3E and 3E-MatterSphere's reports, I built a lot of these in SSRS and 3E's own reporting service.
						</p>
						<p>
							Data Science was something that I found along my programming journey. 
							I had been intending to pursue a master's degree in computer science after completing the ACCA qualification but was introduced to the idea of Data Science instead. 
							FreeCodeCamp had courses on Python and Data Science, so I went through those and started looking through the free section on DataCamp. 
							I managed to get into City University's Data Science course, where I have learnt a lot of theory behind Data Science and Machine Learning (and been reintroduced to MATLAB).
