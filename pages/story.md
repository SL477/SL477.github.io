Warning, contains spoilers!

Doctor Who is my favourite show. Spaceships, time travel, aliens and dinosaurs (Dinosaurs, on a spaceship).
I am slowly working my way through the traditional Who episodes.
But if you were to analyse my Whodle data you would see a clear gap in my knowledge in the Jodie Whittaker era.
The Woman who fell to Earth and Ghost Monument were ok episodes, and Jodie Whittaker brought the same sort of energy as Matt Smith had to the role.
The problems I had were in all of side characters and the plots.
The main problem with the side characters were that the Doctor appeared to keep landing inside Westworld and finding all of these robots who looked human but very obviously weren't.
Almost all of them were either completely perfect or Nazis, with nothing in between.

The best thing about Doctor Who is of course the TARDIS.
Much like the Millennium Falcon, it is ridiculously advanced by our standards but to the Time Lords it's a piece of junk and was on the Gallifreyan equivalent of a scrapyard.
My favourite version was the Grunge phase TARDIS from the Christopher Eccleston/David Tennant era, mostly because it was the first version I saw.

The second problem with the Whittaker era were the plots.
This was mostly because the producers had decided to bring back the multiple companions from the classic Doctor Who but kept, at least at first, the episode structure of the regenerated series.
In classic Doctor Who you generally had five episodes of 30 minutes to tell the story of wherever the TARDIS landed, what was wrong with it, befriend some locals (preferably someone famous if it was historical), solve whatever problem they had and possibly set up/move along some longer story arcs.
In the regenerated series you had one/two episodes of 45 to 60 minutes to do the same thing.
In most of the regenerated series this was fine, you had the Doctor and one companion (apart from when there were two, but generally they were a side companion who could helpfully be left somewhere convenient if the writers couldn't think of what to do with them for an episode or two).

The problem with the Whittaker era was that there were three companions.
Yaz as Exposition and chuckle brothers as comic relief (Ryan and Graham got swapped out for John Bishop and ?).
This meant that there were four main characters in every episode competing for lines and actions, plus they had to share with the guest stars.
Which inevitably meant that the chuckle brothers could get lost, the famous historical person would be told to wait and watch some irrelevance and then the Doctor and Yaz could get on with the plot.

This was then that another of the producer's decisions came back to haunt them.
They had decided 'no more classic villains', fans had cried out for years that the regenerated series only reused classic villains (usually with an update).
This then meant that rather than a Dalek/Cyberman popping in and not needing too much time to establish that they are the villain as everyone knows what they are and want, they had to come up with a new villain and show that they were evil (generally by them being a nazi/Dr Evil).

Supposedly the best episode of Doctor Who is Blink.
I love Blink, but Doctor Who is in it for all of 5 minutes.
It's a bit more of soft horror meets crime drama.
My favourite is The End of the World, spaceship in the very far future and 'a planet about to explode'.
An honourable mention to The Lie of the Land, a powerful moral argument from Missy putting the Doctor in his place, Dinosaurs On A Spaceship (the title tells you that it's awesome) and for the weirdest Listen[^1].

Ncuti Gatwa was an amazing Doctor and had far too short a run.
Boom was certainly his best episode, 73 Yards being a close second (and seeing as how he wasn't in that Joy to the World (or Dot and Bubble, which didn't feature either Ruby or the Doctor)).

## Series 1

Christopher Eccleston was brilliant as the Doctor ('U-boat captain!').
Flying Daleks and the Slitheen.
It was a pity that due to personal reasons he regenerated.
End of the World was the first episode I saw.
It had one hell of a finale on satellite 5.

## Series 2

The Torchwood series.
Introduced at the end of Series 1 David Tennant takes over, while Billie Piper stays as the companion.
As in series 1 there is a brief period with a second companion of Mickey Smith, Rose's boyfriend?
I'm not quite sure why the British government is funding both the British office of UNIT and Torchwood, but apparently they have enough money in the Whoniverse to do that.

I can't remember when, but the Torchwood TV series started after series 2.
It started off good as a sort of adult Dr Who crime/spy drama, but suffered as only seemed to get the stories not good enough for Doctor Who (and tried too hard to be edgy).
The series steadily began to collapse due to being the number 2[^4].
Just because they could, they also started The Adventures of Sarah Jane Smith. This also suffered a bit of getting the off casts of Doctor Who, but seemed to be separate enough to escape the collapse that Torchwood did.

## Series 3

Martha takes over from Rose.
At the beginning the Doctor was just taking her to the same places as Rose.

42 was an absolute gem, this was an episode more or less in real-time as a spaceship dropped towards a star.
Freema really got to shine in this one with the Doctor out of action near the end.
Blink, everyone's favourite episode, was another.
The Weeping Angels were introduced.

Utopia must have been one of the best setups to a finale.
With the TARDIS stolen and a horde of zombies about to break in to eat the Doctor, Martha and Captain Jack.

## Series 4

Catherine Tate takes over from Freema Agyeman as the companion.
Which did boost the show's comedy side.

It was something of a military series with the Doctor's Daughter, Sontaran Strategem, Poison Sky, Stolen Earth and Journeys End.

Midnight was a good episode.
Featuring a possible alien, it was a very good mind trip.

Given that the finale must have had a ridiculous budget they had to save money somewhere (the following year was four specials).

## Series 5

Here we had a complete change, Russell T Davies changed to Steven Moffet as head writer, David Tennant regenerated into Matt Smith and Catherine Tate into Karen Gillen.
Plus the TARDIS regenerated too, the grunge phase turned into the glass palace.

The special effects seemed to have improved from Series 1, as did the budget.
We also see one of the only examples of time travel between episodes in 'Flesh and Stone' and 'The Big Bang', where in the episode it appears as an inconsistency when you first watch it.
The Pandorica Opens seems to one up Utopia.
The Doctor is imprisoned in the Pandorica, Amy is killed and Rory has been turned into a robot.

## Series 6

Here we have the introduction of the Silence as a new recurring villain[^5].
We see a lot more of the TARDIS in the Doctor's Wife.
Human form replicants are seen in The Rebel Flesh and The Almost People.

The epic mid season break is A Good Man Goes To War.
With the Silurians changing into the good guys, although in their first outing in the regenerated series they were on both sides.
The Wedding of River Song must have used up whatever was left of the special effects budget.

## Series 7

Here we have Dinosaurs on a Spaceship.
I would say that the Silurian spaceship was the closest to a Culture starship I've seen on TV.

The Doctor finally goes too far and Amy and Rory get killed.
After a bit of a sulk he recruits Clara as his next companion.
The Great Intelligence returns as a villain.

I really liked The Bells of St John and The Rings of Akhaten.
Then there is the epic Nightmare in Silver, planet full of Cybermen and a planet busting bomb.
I liked the Cyberman's response to the Doctor claiming he was an alien and so useless to them "that was true a long time ago, but we've upgraded ourselves".

The Name of the Doctor sets up some excellent foreshadowing, with the graveyard planet of Trenzalore and a giant TARDIS tomb for the Doctor.

The Day of the Doctor features three Doctors, with the briefly foreshadowed War Doctor appearing. With some excellent timey whimey Galifray is saved[^6].

The Time of the Doctor.
Speculation is rife, there are 12 regenerations per Time Lord and the Doctor has used all of them.
Does the War Doctor count?
Does David Tennant's not quite regeneration in Journey's End count?[^7]
Then the episode happened and they all counted, 12 regenerations and over the centuries on Trenzalore the Doctor ages with no more regenerations.
Once again loads of villains appear.
Also the crack in the universe appears.
The Silence are apparently the confessional priests of the Church of the Papal Mainframe, a revelation off screen it seems.
A faction of which travels back in time to try to prevent the Doctor getting to Trenzalore, in something of a paradox.
Then "At the fall of the eleventh, in a place where no man can lie, since must fall", the Doctor is given more regenerations by the Time Lords and regenerates.

## Series 8

Peter Capaldi is the new Doctor Who.
Originally I didn't like him and the call from Matt Smith in the past didn't help.
His relationship with Clara really didn't work, eventually she becomes something like a Doctor in training.
That said, the series was epic.

Listen was a brilliant episode, were there any aliens?
Plus they appear on Gallifrey, although the Doctor doesn't realise.
Time Heist is another brilliant episode, using time travel to rob a bank after already having broken into in the past.
Mummy on the Orient Express was another cracker, a great big space train.
Death in Heaven saw Missy appear as the female Master, and the Doctor going to try to find Gallifrey and failing.

## Series 9

Another brilliant series!
Heaven Sent is one of my favourites. A great episode, featuring the Doctor on his own. We also get to see the inside of a confession dial and an interesting use of a telephone.
We also get to see the Zygons again.
We also get an entire episode set on Gallifrey!

## Series 10

The last of the classic regenerated series.
After Clara bowed out we get Bill and Nardole as the new companions.
Plus Missy joins as a recurring character.
Oxygen was a brilliant capitalist metaphor.

Then in Extremis we see a great computer simulation, which is a bit like the Matrix.

Then another of my favourites The Lie of the Land.
Missy gives the Doctor a winning strategy that involves effectively killing Bill to save the world and then calls the Doctor out on his double standards when he rejects it out of hand.
As he seems to be fine with other people dying but not Bill.

World Enough and Time, we see what happens when you get too close to a black hole.
As Bill spends ten years at the bottom of the ship the Doctor, Missy and Nardole have a five minute adventure at the top.
The Doctor Falls. "Without hope, without witness."
Missy completes her path to redemption, killing the John Simm Master and being killed in turn, with apparently no hope of regeneration.
The Doctor is suppressing his regeneration, from when is something of an open question.
Bill, transformed into a Cyberman, joins him on a suicide mission.
Twice Upon a Time, we meet the first Doctor.
The Doctor is also reunited with Bill.
Plus we find the origin of the Brigadier.

## Series 14

We get David Tennant and Catherine Tate back!
And Russell T Davies too.
After an eternity of misery in the Whittaker era we get someone who can write an episode of Doctor Who!
Plus all of the Amazon money.

The Star Beast shows some of their new financial muscle and fleshes out UNIT a bit more.
Eventually Ncuti Gatwa takes over, he brings somehow even more more manic energy to the show that David Tennant and Matt Smith combined.
Boom, 73 Yards and Dot and Bubble were all brilliant episodes.

## Series 15

Series 15 was just weird.
I'm not sure I liked the way they strung all of the episodes together and they were too concerned with expensive special effects than anything else[^2].
UNIT got a generic Avengers tower that somehow moved[^3]. For the shear spectacle of it The Interstellar Song Contest.
It was a pity that Ncuti Gatwa bowed out so soon.

[^1]: A second Peter Capaldi episode and I'm tempted to stick in Heaven Sent and Mummy on the Orient Express too, I didn't like Peter Capaldi at first, but he was amazing as were the writers then.

[^2]: Lux as a meta episode was especially bad. The only meta episode I've seen which was good was the Rick and Morty one and that was because they treated the concept with the contempt it deserves.

[^3]: Poison sky as UNIT's best episode, Doctor staring at them in disbelief as they prepared to launch all Earth's nuclear missiles at the Sontarans.

[^4]: Seeing as how Torchwood's HQ was destroyed in Doomsday and apparently never properly recovered it was to an extent doomed from the start.

[^5]: Seeing as how you forget them as soon as you stop looking at them, there's something of an issue with using them as a recurring villain.

[^6]:
    And safely ignored, as it should be.
    It was utterly stupid destroying it again for no reason in the Whittaker era.

[^7]: These are some of the things I really hated about the Jodie Whittaker revelation that there were supposedly more Doctors.
