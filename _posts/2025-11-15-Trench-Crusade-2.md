## The Game
### Turn 1
One of the hell knights rushed forwards into cover behind one of the ruined buildings in the town.
Brother Julius mirrored his actions, but slung his sniper rifle over his shoulder and clambered up two floors of a ruined building. He took aim at the pit locust and fired. He took pride in the solid hit, but tried to suppress his disappointment in that the demon didn't go down.
The sorcerer flew on top of a building, his powers healed the pit locust as he cast a fireball at the sniper priest and immolated him. He dropped back down into cover behind a building.
The preacher strode forward and took a shot at a demon and missed.
One of the yoke fiends gave the wretched, he had been shackled with looking after, a brutal hit to get his blood flowing out. He ran closer to the statue and prayed to it. The statue appeared to grant him its blessing.
The Engineer scuttled into the cover of a building opposite the statue.
The Hunter climbed on top of a ruined building and let loose his bow. It hit the Mechanised Heavy Infantryman and caused a minor wound.
Fire team 1 ran forwards, the two of them took aim with their bolt action rifles and hit the hunter and it vanished into thin air. The two of them started rowing about which of them had hit it.
The sin eater raced forwards to the statue and gained its blessing.
Not having a good feeling about the statue, Lieutenant Carstairs walked forwards and fired his revolver.
One of the hell knights and pit locust moved forwards towards fire team 2 and the preacher.
Shock trooper Darius moved to the lieutenant's left and shot at the sin eater, it dropped with a scream of pain. But it was still alive.
The wretched reluctantly moved up next to the yoke fiend. The yoke fiend fired his blunderbuss and knocked down one of the yeoman in fire team 1.

### Turn 2
Fire team 2 mewed with fear and the cowards let the pit locust get right up to them. One of the yeoman screamed with pain as its tail lashed out at him and then it swiped its claws at him.
Preacher Peter climbed on top of the container next to them and dropped down behind the pit locast. He shot it in the back with his revolver and swiped at it with his sword, missing it. He yelled out a blessing on the wounded yeoman.
The sin eater charged forwards and swallowed Peter whole. The two yeomen screamed in terror.
The Engineer shot the sin eater in the back with the shotgun.
The yoke fiend ran around the statue and got shot at by Lt Carstairs.
The sorcerer flew up on top of the building in was hiding behind and launched a fireball at the lieutenant. Carstairs dropped wounded to the floor, while Engineer George got burned by it.
Darius took a shot at the sin eater's back.
The hell Knight charged into combat with the Heavy Mechanised Infantryman.
Fire team 1's conscious member shot at the mêlée, trying to hit the hell Knight but hitting Graham, the Heavy Mechanised Infantryman.

### Turn 3
Fire team 2 was split up permanently as one of the two yeomen was killed by a Hell Knight.
Darius let fly with his submachine gun and the sin eater died. Preacher Peter burst out of the dead sin eater's stomach and collapsed exhausted to the ground. He glared at Darius in disapproval as he yelled his thanks to the statue.
The pit locast fell on him and mauled him to death.
The surviving member of Fire team 2 raced away from the melee and shot at the Hell Knight.
The sorcerer hurled another spell at Shock Trooper Darius, but he survived.
Engineer George killed the pit locast with his shotgun.
The Hell Knight swung his axe into the downed form of Graham and the Heavy Mechanised Infantryman stood back up and replied with his axe, knocking down the Hell Knight.
The Yoke Fiend shot at fire team 1, giving one of the yeoman a glancing hit.
Fire Team 1 took their revenge, one yeoman killed the Yoke Fiend and then the other took a pot shot at the sorcerer.
The wretched yelled his thanks to the statue, and gained a minor curse for his trouble.

### Turn 4
The surviving member of Fire team 2 shot at the Hell Knight and missed.
The Hell Knight tried to get his revenge and missed.
George missed with his shot at the Hell Knight. The sorcerer then missed at a shot at Darius.
Darius then shot to death the sorcerer with his submachine gun. Yelling his thanks to the statue.
The other Hell Knight swung at Graham and was killed in turn by the Heavy Mechanised Infantryman.
The wretched prayed to the statue again, receiving a blessing in return. His freedom was short lived as fire team 1 moved in and shot him to death.

The surviving demons of the court had vanished from the field. The surviving Scottish troops glared at the statue and went to help their fallen comrades.

## Post match analysis
This was my first go with the New Antioch warband. Their Heavy Mechanised Infantry look big and mean, but aren't too much better than the standard troops.
By victory points New Antioch won, by one point.
Their standard troops are fairly tough and able to take a bit of punishment.
Basically my strategy was to move my troops into cover and leave them there. All but one had a gun. The disadvantage of being a mêlée focused army is that you have to go to the enemy.
