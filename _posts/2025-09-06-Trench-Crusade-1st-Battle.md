The prophet led his small congregation through the bombed out trenches on the edge of the front. The visions were clear, the relics were close.

A fly demon flew into a bombed out building ahead and took a shot at the communicant.
Blaring his horn he charged across a rickety bridge, his nun and pump cannon trooper dashed with him. He fired his pistol and the demon fell.

The plague demons shuffled forwards to the relic shrines. The anchorite shrine lumbered forwards. To the prophet's right the two troopers took shots at the demons facing them. To his left the communicant was assailed by a fast zombie. The penal trooper with his martyrdom device and handler watched dumbstruck as the communicant and zombie grappled with each other.

The pump cannon trooper took a shot at the horde of zombies at the rear of the trenches.
Hell hounds leapt up onto the platform above the trenches where the prophet and central relic were. The demon prince charged with them. The nun got attacked by one of the hounds, while the demon prince charged the prophet. The prophet took a seemingly mortal wound and then collapsed as another demon stabbed him.

The anchorite shrine took a bullet shot. The pump cannon trooper climbed up onto an ancient container and took a shot at the demon prince. A zombie clambered up after him and killed him.
The communicant and zombie grappled in the mud. Sensing his chance for redemption and pushing on by his handler, the penal trooper climbed onto the platform. At the feet of the demon prince he detonated the device. The demon prince vanished. Somehow Bob the penal trooper still lived and crawled over to the shrine.

Sister Agnes did not see the moment that Bob fell, he was finished off by the zombie who had killed the pump cannon trooper. She efficiently swung her sword and fired her pistols at the hell hounds attacking her. She allowed herself a sigh of satisfaction as the last one fell. A lord of decay, who had crept up behind her stabbed her in the back.

The anchorite shrine swung its mace and Catherine wheel at the demonic horde around it. Screaming prayers the priest pilot swung his two weapons, battering at the demons.

To his right one of the two troopers was killed by the final hell hound. Corporal Jeffrey killed it in turn.

Private Johnson kicked the zombie when the communicant beat it down. It shuffled up again and the communicant finally killed it.

He took a shot at one of the shuffling zombies, he did not understand why they had been so hesitant.

Jeffrey's heart sank as the anchorite shrine was knocked down, as one of the demons looked at him he shot it in the chest. Using the distraction the shrine raised itself back up and struck down another of the greater demons.

As if that had finally broken them the demons and hell spawn shuffled and ran back to the hell they had come from.

Jeffrey looked through the small shrine he had secured, there was little that looked important but they may have scared these plague demons away. His wound from the plague hell hound blistered with unnatural infection.

Private Johnson stumbled through the trenches, he had collected Sister Agnes' rosary and clutched a battered book.

"We found this at our shrine, it seemed important." He explained. The communicant looked on approvingly and touched Jeffrey's wound. It became much more bearable after that.
"Come brothers, we have more demons to slay." Said the anchorite shrine's pilot priest.

## Post battle analysis
I went into this with relatively little knowledge of Trench Crusade. My main trick was charging straight at the objective markers and ignoring all else. Which worked well in terms of winning, but had the slight strategic issue in that everyone died.
It plays a lot like Kill-Team, but admittedly I've only played that once too.
