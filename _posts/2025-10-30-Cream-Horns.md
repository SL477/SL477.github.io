I mostly followed [Paul Hollywood's cream horn recipe](https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/recipes/all/paul-hollywood-cream-horns/), apart from substituting milk chocolate for dark chocolate (as dark chocolate is disgusting) and ground ginger instead of crystallised stem ginger (Lidl didn't have it and I didn't have the faintest idea of what I was looking for).

The filling tasted like ice cream and the horns tasted like an ice cream cornet crossed with a croissant.

## Tips
Paul Hollywood says you need just 4-5 tablespoons of water, he must be using ladles as spoons as I need about 10 before I gave up and poured water over it.

Also try not to have a British Gas appointment in the middle of making it, as they tend to be rather distracting.
