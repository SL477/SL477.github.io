## Wordle
My best word was Prose that I got in two. On average I solved it in 4.25 guesses.

## Modelling
I finally finished my Space Marines from each Loyalist First Founding chapter.
I think my best one was the Salamander, although the Alpha Legionnaire was actually the best (but so tricky that I'm not going to build an army of them)[^1].

Trench Crusade is a good game that I was introduced to. The world is not as fleshed out as Warhammer 40k, but I've played it (not played 40k since school). My New Antioch warband managed to acquit itself well in their only battle.

## Moving
I am slowly moving home and hopefully will be done in 2026.

## Reading
I finished reading The Battle of the Arctic and No Hero Just a Survivor. These were about the battle of the Arctic and the war in the air over first the Middle East and then Burma.

My Grandad on my Mum's side served on destroyers that escorted the Arctic Convoys. And my Grandad on my Dad's side was in the 47th Squadron of the RAF (at least in the Aegean Campaign[^2], I think he was with a different squadron in Burma).

It was interesting learning about these bits of World War 2 that they were part of, it shows just how big WW2 was. As each destroyer carried hundreds of crew and 14-30 escorted each convoy, in a bit of the war that rarely gets much mention in documentaries. Each RAF squadron had 250-300 people (pilots, navigators, mechanics and other support crew), and the 47th operated alongside several others (from America, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Canada too) showing just how international the war was.

I read 44 books in total during the year (at least after I discovered Good Reads in March). Quite a few of them Agatha Christie's as I tried to read all of them.

## Work
I am enjoying using EDG[^3] I had not used it much at my old job, it is generally easier to test (depending upon the template) as things are separate.

I used Power Apps in practice, I had used them before on Microsoft Learn. Theory and Practice are a bit different.

Most of my work is in 3E's IDE, using good old VB.Net[^4] and OQL[^5].

## Travel
I went to the Birmingham Festival of Railway Modelling in November to see all of the model railways and gain inspiration[^7].

I also went to Hemsby (in Norfolk). Which was nice, a little sad as more of it fell into the sea.

## Food
I have become a lot more adventurous in my cooking this year. For a while I was subscribed to Hello Fresh, which was a very good way of getting a wide variety of recipes very quickly[^8].

## Next year
Hopefully I'll finish moving home and release my app. Maybe I'll finish writing my book[^6].

More stuff will go into this website and more books will be read. Hopefully I'll play more Trench Crusade too. Possibly I'll go on a foreign adventure too.

[^1]: and if you want to be pedantic they aren't Loyalist.

[^2]: the Aegean Campaign was to try to take and hold the Greek Islands. These had been taken by the Axis powers early in the war and garrisoned by Italy. After Italy surrendered to the Allies the islands, briefly, passed to the Allies. These were taken again by the Axis powers, who still controlled Greece and Albania, a lot closer to the islands than Egypt (where the Allies were operating from, as those in Italy were busy trying to take Italy).

[^3]: Or 3ET, Elite Design Gallery or 3E Templates. A way of producing Word/PDF/text/XML documents using XSLT from XML.

[^4]: One day Elite may be forced to go to C#. Which I know too.

[^5]: Object Query Language, SQL meets VB.Net. Basically you need to know SQL too.

[^6]: Ok, it's been finished for two years or so, but I'm very slowly editing it. And the app is fully feature complete.

[^7]: I went there and back in one day. Not sure I want to do that again next year!

[^8]: A lack of choice and all of the waste packaging put me off. But it was a good way of getting moving boxes I guess!
