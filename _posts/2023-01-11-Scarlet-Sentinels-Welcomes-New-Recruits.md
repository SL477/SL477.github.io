The Scarlet Sentinels Chapter welcomes Lieutenant Kieran Cadmus and Librarian Zao Urbane as its first Primaris Space Marines.

Chapter Master Alexander Lima and Captain Lucius Vault welcomed them and a squad of Outriders into the Third Company and to the Angel Bastion on Saint Marilyn.

All five of the new recruits have served the Imperium well in the Unnumbered Sons and are keen to fight alongside their brothers in the chapter.

Archmagos Dominus Belisarius Cawl sent with them a stock of new geneseed to manufacture more Primaris Marines. With the losses the Chapter took at Baal these recruits are welcome indeed.
