*Lieutenant Kieran Cadmus and Librarian Zao Urbane*

Chapter Master Alexander Lima and Captain Lucius Vault welcomed them into the Third Company and to the Angel Bastion on Saint Marilyn.

Both of the two new recruits have served the Imperium well in the Unnumbered Sons and are keen to fight alongside their brothers in the chapter.

Archmagos Dominus Belisarius Cawl sent with them a stock of new geneseed to manufacture more Primaris Marines.
