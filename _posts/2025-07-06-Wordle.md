Inspired by [Btream's Wordle page](https://btrem.com/feed/wordle) I created my own one.
After all I've been an avid [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) player for quite a while now.

I had been messaging people my Wordle stats religiously more or less since I started.
So to get my stats I exported the messages from Whatsapp and used a regular expression to capture my stats.

Effectively this:

```js
/(Wordle [\d,]+ .\/6\s*[â¬›ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©\s]+)/gm;
```

I had hoped to just use Jekyll's Liquid templating to build the stats.
But it does not seem possible to use a text file as a source.
So I created a JavaScript script to create a YAML data file which could just be handed off to the Jekyll Liquid template [^1].

I would like this to run automatically, but I'm not sure how I would do this in Jekyll [^2].

[^1]: The random numbers are the figures to balance back to my official stats on Wordle, as it appears that I was not always so good at keeping these figures.

[^2]: A potential feature for my vague idea of building my own static site generator.
