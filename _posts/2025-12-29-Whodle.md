Based upon my Whodle page I decided to start saving my [Whodle](https://whodle.dixonary.co.uk/) scores.

This was a little different than my Wordle page as the sharing text is slightly different, so I ended up spliting it up into two line groups.
Then I used this regex to get the number and if I won or not:

```js
/(I got \w+'s Whodle in \d)|(I didn't)/gm
```

Then it was just a case of building a data page.
I am now using the command line to build the stats.
