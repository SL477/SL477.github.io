Originally from the [Bear Blog challenge](https://blog.absurdpirate.com/bear-blog-carnival-november-whats-in-my-inventory/).

## The items

- Keys, the keys to my house with my Tesco's clubcard. My original clubcard went through the wash, but I eventually found my keyring clubcard.
- Cards. Bank cards and my National Trust card (I've not used it too often, but I feel like I should support them). Nectar card, I love a bargain!
- Hand sanitizer, started carrying it in COVID and didn't stop (some would say I started carrying it many years earlier).
- 3DS, great games console. Advance Wars, Lego Star Wars, Lego Jurassic Park.
- Google Pixel phone. I moved from the iPhone, to Samsung, to another Android, to the iPhone again and back to Android. It's now been going for a good few years, it doesn't seem that phones really change anymore.
