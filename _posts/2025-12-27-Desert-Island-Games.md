The question is: if you were stranded on a desert island, which game would you bring? No internet and everything magically works.

If that happened I think the three types of games to think of are those that are a sandbox, those that are endlessly replayable and those that are so absurdly long that finishing them would require you to be stranded on a desert island.

## Sandbox

Under this category I would definitely go for Factorio. You build a factory to escape the planet and while you're at it you commit multiple war crimes against the biters.

How it starts:
> I'm going to do a nice mostly peaceful run where I'll only attack the biters in self defense.

How it ends:
> I have brought peace, freedom, democracy to my new empire
> -- <cite>Anakin Skywalker, Star Wars Episode 3</cite>


I've not played the Space Age expansion, mostly because I'd need to be on this island to get enough time to do so.

Honourable mention Hearts of Iron 4. This is a game that I was always really bad at. I wasn't too terrible at first, but then they kept patching it and changing it and you basically needed to get training at a military academy to have any chance of beating it.

Basically the only way to get anywhere was either crazy scenarios or mods that just let you win.

I think this game only works if it's a turn based game, when you are at peace there is pretty much nothing to do and when you are at war then there is so much going on that the computer can just sneak things through while you're suffering from information overload.

Basically the desert island would mean that HOI4's makers couldn't patch my version so that I would actually be able to play it.

## Replayable

Knights of the Old Republic 2

I missed so much when I first played it through and on my second attempt steam deleted my save. But there is a lot in there to do and you can play through as a Jedi and then as a Sith.

Honourable mention Hogwarts Legacy, I've played through as a Griffindor, so just three other houses to go through.

Other honourable mention, Rogue Trader. I'm still playing this, but I can see many places where you can do things differently and many places where I would want to do them differently now I know what happens.

## So big you won't finish them

Skyrim, or Morrowind (not played the earlier Elder Scrolls games). I gave up on Skyrim so that I could have a life again. There was just so much stuff in it. No idea if I was anywhere even vaguely near the end. It was just too much.

## Conclusion 

I would go for Factorio, it's a great game. You can make some intricate electric gadgets, drive trains, make a rally circuit in the car, ride out in the tank or just sit back and watch your industrial monster consume all of the planet's resources to make science.
