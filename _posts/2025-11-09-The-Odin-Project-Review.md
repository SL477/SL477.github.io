I have now completed [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)'s Ruby on Rails track.

It was a very long journey through the Odin Project.
I originally started it to learn more about Ruby to help with the templating of this site.

Ruby on Rails was a somewhat miserable system to work with, mostly because I prefer less opinionated web frameworks such as Node.js and Flask.

I do like the idea of embedding React into Rails, I wouldn't like to have too separate websites going.

The JavaScript was also useful, more modern JavaScript may be coming into my site at some point!
