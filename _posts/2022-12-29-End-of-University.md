excerpt: A brief summary of what I did in my university projects

I am now (hopefully) finished at university.
My final epic project has been handed in.

My project was an internship with QCP, so I cannot go into too much detail, but this is a screenshot of the public test application.
But it was to do with recommendation engines and predicting the futures of companies.

As part of it I had the pleasure of translating a Tensorflow v1 model into PyTorch, scraping thousands of websites, using the MySQL Docker image, creating a Python package and using Node.JS with Python.

This culminated in a huge report for City University.

For my other modules I created a computer game for an AI to play in Deep Reinforcement Learning.
Analysed the Secrets of Dumbledore trailer for characters' emotions in Computer Vision.
Built a Spark cluster in Google Cloud in Big Data.
Compared a Neural Network with a Support Vector machine in classifying data in Neural Computing.
Predicted the prices of used Ford cars in Machine Learning.
Predicted trends in Covid-19 data in Visual Analytics.
Analysed US airline data in Introduction to Data Science.

Through this course I increased my knowledge of Python, rediscovered MATLAB and discovered LaTex.
I also looked at the science behind various machine learning models and made a fair few of them myself.
