I had my first taste of modular CSS so that I could keep the styles on the different pages apart.
A method that I hope to use some more.
It was very good to be able to use some proper intellisense for CSS.

GitHub Pages was unable to run the site as a Browser Router, so it uses the Hash Router instead.
