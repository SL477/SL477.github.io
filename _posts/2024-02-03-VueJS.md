Continuing on from my previous post where I moved one of my React Pages, I have now removed VueJS from my main site.

The VueJS page I made in a [tutorial from FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-portfolio-with-vuejs/) was never part of the site's navigation.
But it had a folder that sat in the repository and no longer does.
I changed what I had made in the tutorial to use the .Vue files rather than be transpiled on the fly.
And it no longer uses Axios.
It can be viewed [here](https://link477.com/Link477Vue/#/) and the repo is [here](https://github.com/SL477/Link477Vue).

From revisiting that, I can appreciate why React is king!
I found VueJS to be a bit unhelpful when it came to error messages (it probably did not help that I also used Vite rather than the Create Vue App).
While I appreciate the separation of concerns between the logic and display I prefer reacts way (and not having VSCode complain about everything).

I had found that my vue_page template had been used a few times on this site.
These pages no longer use VueJS and are now regular JS.
Some like the Simon Game were easy to take VueJS off.
The FCCForum page, that was another story (this one showed the benefits of a JavaScript framework!).
