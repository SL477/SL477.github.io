[The original 10 questions challenge](https://forkingmad.blog/ten-pointless-facts-about-me/)

## Do you floss your teeth?
No. I know that I should do. I had a retainer to try to align my teeth and it broke my jaw, so letting it heal up and then I'll have the joys of starting again (with a reputable company that hasn't been sued to oblivion).

## Tea, coffee, or water?
Water. Tea and coffee are disgusting! Although I can get through plenty of sugary drinks (I feel I should link back to question 1 here).

## Footwear preference?
Trainers. I have a pair of walking trainers, which are somewhere between regular trainers and walking boots. I do do a fair amount of walking in them.

## Favourite dessert?
Belgian waffles. I don't have them nearly as regularly as I'd like, but that's probably a good thing.

Banoffee pie is also a brilliant dessert. It even has fruit in it, so it must be good for you!

## The first thing you do when you wake up?
Turn my alarm off and have breakfast. Sometimes a load more reading.

## Age you'd like to stick at?
About 30-ish would be nice. But who knows how I'll feel when I get older.

## How many hats do you own?
One. A Santa hat that I use as a Christmas decoration. I've never really liked hats.

## Describe the last photo you took?
I took a series of pictures of my Trench Crusade New Antioch warband. The last one specifically of Brother Matheus, my machine gun priest, standing on the gantry of my dice tower (it's a dice tower and a piece of scenery).

## Worst TV show?
I watch an awful lot of TV. I gave up on Coronation Street (and other soaps) a long time ago, as something of a waste of time.

Stargate Universe also felt like a waste of time now. The first part of season 1 was rather unbearable, but I'll grudgingly admit that it got better and the general setting also had problems. Making the Lucian Alliance the big bad was certainly a mistake, they eventually started making the villains at the Destiny side better. The psychic body swapping stuff was creepy and the writers really didn't think that through (trying to not make it too much like Stargate Atlantis).

## As a child, what was your aspiration for adulthood?
At one point I wanted to be a vicar and at another point a doctor. I also wanted to become a games developer, as a software developer I'm not too far away from that.
