I first saw this challenge [on Adactio's blog](https://adactio.com/journal/21674).

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

It seemed like a good idea at the time!
Initially it was one of those suggestions of you should create a personal website and then start blogging on it as a way to expand your portfolio of personal projects.

But since then I've just decided to blog about whatever I want, whenever I want!
Although there will still be the occasional post about various other projects.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you chose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before?

I am using Jekyll hosted on GitHub Pages.
GitHub Pages was chosen because it was free!
Originally my personal site was on GitHub Pages & made of raw HTML/CSS/JS (which I originally made on CodePen as part of a FreeCodeCamp challenge project).
The blog side of it was on WordPress.com.

After one too many times of needing to update every page to update dependencies I was desperate for another way.
Then I remembered all of the stuff I deleted from the initial GitHub Pages project.
I went to the initial commit and branched off of it, then restored all of the content.
Then as Jekyll was originally for blogging I copied over everything from WordPress (channelling the IndieWeb spirit long before I had heard of it).

## How do you write your posts? For example in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that's part of your blog?

My posts are written in MarkDown in VSCode.
As I still have access to the WordPress site I have very occasionally drafted some posts in the WordPress app and then copied them over to my site.

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

If I have finished something that I'm especially proud of I might _finish it_ by adding a blog post.
Otherwise it is at the whims of fate, or when I'm procrastinating on something[^1].

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

Normally immediately after writing.
My conscience points out that the rest of my Blood-Bowl series has been languishing in Word for about three years now[^2].

Plus I think I have a couple of other entries in my WordPress drafts!

## What's your favourite post on your blog?

I think I quite liked [Kill Team](https://link477.com/2022/04/16/Kill-Team.html).
It was based, more or less, on my first Kill Team match[^3].
It had absolutely nothing to do with the tech-blog style theme that was my original inspiration (given that my first post was on Blood Bowl you can tell how religiously I stuck to the professional theme).

I now have two Space Marine Kill Teams (both varieties of the Phobos Strike team, the Infiltrators the originals and the Incursors kit-bashed from Intercessors with the remaining parts).
No Orks are in my collection yet, so if I ever do a follow up it may have to be completely made up.

## Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?

At the moment I am part way through adding notes to the site.
If you can see this, then hopefully I have finished that[^4].
I have also been working on [IndieWebifying](https://indieweb.org/) my site and working down the [Front-End Checklist](https://frontendchecklist.io/).

I discovered footnotes while writing this, and intend to use them a lot more.
I have also been slowly working through the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and some of these things will hopefully join the site.
Plus of course there is everything in the GitHub Issues/Project for this site[^5].

At some point I intend to add a toggle for dark-mode/light-mode and to redesign the home page.

## Next?

I am slowly approaching the end of another major project, which eventually I will elaborate on (it has taken about 4 years and my aim is to complete it this year).
Also I have plans to create a computer game of some description.

[^1]: Such as now.

[^2]: Some day I shall edit them and publish them. The first entry is [here](https://link477.com/2021/08/17/Blood-Bowl-1st-Match.html).

[^3]: I was the Orks, Guy Cutler the Imperial Guard. Recollections may vary!

[^4]: Carefully keeping to the one major change per feature branch!

[^5]: More a list of shame at this point!
