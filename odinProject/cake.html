    <li>Beat in the eggs</li>
    <li>Fold in the flour</li>
    <li>
    Bake at 180°c for 20 minutes in greased baking tins. You may then need
    to leave it for a few more minutes. When it is cooked the sponge will
    bounce back when you press on it.

    For the buttercream icing boil some water. Then put the icing sugar and
    butter into a bowl. Drop a couple of drops of boiling water into the
    icing mix along with some melted chocolate. Mix the mixture

    cake. Coat with melted chocolate and decorate as required.
